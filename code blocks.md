Here is my code:
    
    var x = 100;
    const dog = 'snickers';
    
    ```
        $age = 65;
        $name = jhon doe;
        echo strtoupper($name);
    ```
    
    Hey this is a single line of code `var = 100;`?
    
    ``` diff
        var x = 200;
        - var y = 300;
        + var x = 500;
    ```
